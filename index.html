            Welcome to Sharetogeda, a non-profit food donation website dedicated to serving the community in Nigeria. Our mission is to bridge the gap between food wastage and hunger by collecting surplus food from individuals and organizations and distributing them to those in need.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Sharetogeda, we believe that every person has the right to access nutritious food. Unfortunately, due to various socioeconomic factors, many individuals and families in Nigeria struggle to meet their basic needs, including food. This is where our organization comes in. We work tirelessly to ensure that no one in our community goes hungry by connecting surplus food with those who need it most.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our team is made up of passionate individuals who are dedicated to making a positive impact in the world. We understand that food insecurity is a complex issue, and we strive to address it from multiple angles. In addition to our food donation program, we also provide educational resources to our community, such as cooking classes and nutritional information, to help promote healthy eating habits.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
            We are committed to transparency and accountability in all aspects of our operations. We maintain detailed records of all donations and distributions, and we regularly publish reports on our website to keep our donors and supporters informed of our progress.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Sharetogeda, we believe that working together is the key to creating a better world. We welcome partnerships with individuals and organizations who share our vision and are committed to fighting hunger in Nigeria. Together, we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of those who need it most.
        </p> -->

        <p>
            Thank you for your interest in our organization, and we invite you to join us in our mission to end hunger in Nigeria.

                <p>
                    If it is still safe to consume, we can collect any perishable or frozen food (meat, diary and seafood included) that is on or before its "use by" date as well as any non-perishable food that is up to three months
                    past its "best before" date.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Please make sure that all food is maintained in a food-safe environment until it is collected. We adhere to
                    strict food safety regulations and provide for the most vulnerable members of the community. Our drivers are
                    taught to recognize dangers and are told to disregard anything they deem unsafe.

                    You may significantly help those in need in your community while also lowering your personal waste and
                    disposal costs by preserving high-quality surplus food.
